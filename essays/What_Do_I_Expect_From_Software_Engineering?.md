1: questions oneslef and ignorance, my lack of experience beyond simple programming algs and concepts
2: My expectations on what I want to learn from this class
3: How I may apply this in the future. 3d graphics and stuff

As you can see from the title, I ask this question to myself when I started taking Introduction to Software Engineering. Although I have the experience of writting code and making simple programs that does a designated task, I do not have the same skills when it comes to making full blown applications and software that provide a variety of uses that isn't just sorting an array. Sure, I may have dabbled in more complicated areas such as modding or using graphics APIs. But its not to an extent where I have created something useful outside of just learning them. So I dont really have clear goals and a grasp on what I will be learning for this class. 

Though I am approaching this class without a strong understanding of software engineering, I can still hold expectations about what I will learn throughout this course.
